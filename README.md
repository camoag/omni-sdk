with pytest. If you would like to test any changes against a live server you can use any apps in the `/examples` directory.

Prerequisites:
- [Python >= 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)

Install dependencies.
```bash
poetry install
```

Run tests.
```bash
poetry run pytest
```

Preview documentation.
```bash
poetry run mkdocs serve
```

### Code Style

- Code is formatted using [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
- Typing is enforced with [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).


### How should I write my commits?

This project uses [release please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) and [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for versioning releases.

Per [release-please-action](https://github.com/google-github-actions/release-please-action):

> The most important prefixes you should have in mind are:
>
> - `fix``: which represents bug fixes, and correlates to a SemVer patch.
> - `feat``: which represents a new feature, and correlates to a SemVer minor.
> - `feat!``:, or fix!:, refactor!:, etc., which represent a breaking change (indicated by the !) and will result in a SemVer major.

Any PR with `fix`, `feat`, `docs`, or a conventional commit with an `!` will trigger a release PR when merged.

Other conventional commits such as `chore`, `ci`, `test`, `refactor`, etc will not trigger a release but are encouraged to form a standard around conventional commits in the commit history.
